# Substance Painter GLSL Shader
## Introduction
GLSL 3.30 shaders for use in Substance Painter. Substance Painter only supports custom fragment
shaders. Only the diffuse and ambient occlusion channels are currently supported.

## Installation
Simply drag the .frag file to the shelf in Substance Painter. The shader will
now be available to select. Each texture set can have a unique instance of the
shader with different values.
