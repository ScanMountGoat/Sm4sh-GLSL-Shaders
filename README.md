# Substance-Sm4sh-Shaders
## Introduction
GLSL 3.30 shaders for use in Substance Painter. The shader code is as close as
possible to the shaders I developed for [Smash
Forge](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge). The shader is functional but
is still a major work in progress. The shader is designed primarily for
character models.

## Installation
Simply drag the .frag file to the shelf in Substance Painter. The shader will
now be available to select. Each texture set can have a unique instance of the
shader with different values.
