# Smash 4 for Wii U GLSL Shaders
## Introduction
GLSL 3.30 shaders for use in Autodesk Maya and Substance Painter. The shader code is as close as
possible to the shaders I developed for [Smash
Forge](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge). The shaders are functional but
are still a major work in progress. The shaders are designed primarily for
character models. Most effect models will not render properly with these shaders. Stage models
tend to have simpler materials, so no custom shader is necessary.

## Installation
See the README.md in the respective folders for installation instructions.
