# Substance-Sm4sh-Shaders
## Introduction
GLSL 3.30 shaders for use in Substance Painter. The shader code is as close as possible to the
shaders I developed for [Smash Forge](https://github.com/jam1garner/Smash-Forge). The shader
compiles, but it won't be in a usable state for a while. The shader is designed primarily for
character models. 

## Installation
Simply drag the .glsl file to the shelf in Substance Painter. The shader will now be available to
select. Each texture set can have a unique instance of the shader with different values.
